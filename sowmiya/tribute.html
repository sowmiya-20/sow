  <h4>Biography</h4>
<p> Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu was born Aug. 26, 1910, in Macedonia to a financially comfortable Albanian family (they owned two houses, one of which they lived in). Her father died when she was 8, ending her family’s financial security.

   Agnes was fascinated with missionaries from an early age, and by 12 she knew that she would commit herself to a religious vocation.

   When she was 18, Agnes left home and joined the Sisters of Loreto in Rathfarnham, Ireland.
 Although she lived to be 87, she never saw her mother or sister again after the day she left for Ireland.

 After a year learning English in Ireland, Agnes transferred to the Sisters of Loreto convent in Darjeeling, India.

   She took her vows as a nun in 1931, choosing the name Teresa to honor Saints Therese of Lisieux and Teresa of Avila.

   Therese of Lisieux, the patron saint of Australia, is also the patron of missionaries, florists and AIDS sufferers, among others. Spain’s patron saint, Teresa of Avila, is also the patron of religious orders and lacemakers.

   Sister Teresa began teaching history and geography in Calcutta at St. Mary’s, a high school for the daughters of the wealthy. She remained there for 15 years and enjoyed the work, but was distressed by the poverty she saw all around her. In 1946 Teresa traveled to Darjeeling for a retreat. It was on that journey that she realized what her true calling was: “I heard the call to give up all and follow Christ into the slums to serve him among the poorest of the poor.”
It took two years of preparation before she was able to begin doing the work she felt compelled to do. She needed to receive permission from the Sisters of Loreto to leave the order – while retaining her vows – as well as permission from the Archbishop
  of Calcutta to live and work among the poor. She also prepared by taking a nursing course.

  

  

   She went on to open a hospice for the poor, a home for sufferers of leprosy, and a home for orphans and homeless youths.

   Mother Teresa was honored with many awards throughout her life, from the Indian Padma Shri in 1962 to the inaugural Pope John XXIII Peace Prize in 1971 to Albania’s Golden Honour of the Nation in 1994… and, most famously, the Nobel Peace Prize in
  1979.

 
   After being beatified in 2003, Mother Teresa was canonized on Sep. 4, 2016. In a ceremony at St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis declared her a saint, yet noted, "With great spontaneity, I think we will continue to call her Mother Teresa."</p>



<h4>International Charity and Recognition</h4>

<p>  In February 1965, Pope Paul VI bestowed the Decree of Praise upon the Missionaries of Charity, which prompted Mother Teresa to begin expanding internationally. By the time of her death in 1997, the Missionaries of Charity numbered more than 4,000—in addition
  to thousands more lay volunteers—with 610 foundations in 123 countries around the world. The Decree of Praise was just the beginning, as Mother Teresa received various honors for her tireless and effective charity. She was awarded the Jewel of India,
  the highest honor bestowed on Indian civilians, as well as the now-defunct Soviet Union's Gold Medal of the Soviet Peace Committee. In 1979, Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her work "in bringing help to suffering humanity
